        <p>
        In my opinion, the vacation spot is Hawaii. Three years ago, I went to Hawaii with my husband and with my daughter. 
        We spent about a week there. Somethihng I love the most about Hawaii is that the culture is different than any other state I have gone to in the US. 
        I enjoy warm weather the most, and sitting by the pool everyday in Hawaii brought me so much peace. Everyone we met there were enjoying themselves. </p>

                 <p>In Hawaii I was able to wear dresses all week. I remember being really excited to shop for the most colorful dresses, 
                 especially since I cannot wear dresses everyday here in Saint Louis.
                     </p>
                <p>If I could choose one vacation spot for the rest of my life, 
                    I would definitely choose Hawaii. I hope to go there again soon with my family.
                     Maybe even for a longer period of time! Last time we went to Big Island, so I would love to go to Mauii or Honolulu next.
